<p>This document outlines the steps needed to install Oxipay on your PrestaShop store.</p>
<div class="panel">
  At the time of writing this article, Oxipay was developed and tested against PrestaShop version <code>1.6.1.9</code>. Please note, however, that the plugin should still be compatible with  PrestaShop versions <code>1.6.X</code> and <code>1.7.X</code>.
</div>

<h2 id="installing-oxipay">Installing Oxipay</h2>
<div class="panel">
  You will need your <b>Merchant ID</b> and an <b>Encryption Key</b> handy before continuing with the installation procedure. They are required to uniquely identify the Merchant and provide a secure link. If you don't have either of these, please contact <a href="mailto:support@oxipay.com.au">support@oxipay.com.au</a>
</div>

<p>The plugin can be installed automatically via PrestaShop's admin panel. This section details how to upload the plugin, and install and configure its various parameters for it to work properly.</p>
<div class="panel">
  Installation of the plugin requires you to be able to access the store's admin area. If you have trouble accessing your PrestaShop's admin area, please consult <a href="http://doc.prestashop.com/dashboard.action">PrestaShop's official support documentation</a> or your IT department to resolve the issue.
</div>

<h3 id="installation-procedure">Installation Procedure</h3>
<p><strong>1</strong> - Navigate to the following URL and select the zip file to download the Oxipay plugin.</p>
<p>For PrestaShop 1.6<br />
<a href="https://github.com/oxipay/oxipay-prestashop-1.6/releases">https://github.com/oxipay/oxipay-prestashop-1.6/releases</a></p>
<p>For PrestaShop 1.7<br />
<a href="https://github.com/oxipay/oxipay-prestashop-1.7/releases">https://github.com/oxipay/oxipay-prestashop-1.7/releases</a></p>
<div class="panel">
  <b>oxipay-prestashop</b> is a private GitHub repository. If you don't have access, please contact <a href="mailto:support@oxipay.com.au">support@oxipay.com.au</a> to get access or to receive the plugin via email.
</div>

<p><strong>2</strong> - Log into your PrestaShop's admin area.</p>
<p><img alt="1.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>3</strong> - Once logged in, you will be presented with your store's dashboard. From the side menu that appears to the left, hover over <strong>Modules and Services</strong> and then click on <strong>Modules and Services</strong> from the sub-menu that appears.</p>
<p><img alt="2.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/2.png" /></p>
<p><strong>4</strong> - This will take you to the <strong>Modules and Services</strong> page and will display a list of modules that are available to you that can be either installed or configured on your store.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> - Scroll down until you bring the <strong>Modules List</strong> panel into focus. Ensure that the two <strong>Filter by</strong> drop-downs are configured to display <strong>Installed &amp; Not Installed</strong> plugins as well as those that are <strong>Enabled &amp; Disabled</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="3.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/3.png" /></p>
<div class="panel">
  You might be presented with a warning at the top of the page indicating that you don't have <b>Bank wire</b> or <b>Payment by check</b> enabled on your site. If you don't intend on processing payment using either of those methods, then you can ignore this warning message.
  <br>
  <br>

  <img alt="warning-1.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/warning-1.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;display: block;">
</div>

<p><strong>6</strong> - Scroll to the top of the page and then click on the <strong>Add a new module</strong> icon. This will open up the <strong>Add a new module</strong> panel.</p>
<p><img alt="4.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/4.png" /></p>
<p><strong>7</strong> - From within the <strong>Add a new module</strong> panel, click on <strong>Choose a file</strong>. This will allow you to specify the folder or directory that contains the Oxipay .zip plugin. Once selected, click on <strong>Upload this module</strong> to initiate the uploading of the plugin.</p>
<p><img alt="5.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/5.png" /></p>
<p><strong>8</strong> - If the upload of the plugin was successful, you will be presented with a success alert at the top of the page.</p>
<p><img alt="6.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/6.png" /></p>
<p><strong>9</strong> - To confirm that the plugin was successfully uploaded to PrestaShop, scroll downwards and bring the <strong>Modules List</strong> panel into focus. In the search field in the top left hand corner of the panel, type in <strong>oxipay</strong> as per the screenshot below. This will filter all modules out but will leave the <strong>Oxipay PrestaShop</strong> module in focus.</p>
<p><img alt="7.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/7.png" /></p>
<div class="panel">
  Depending on the version of the plugin that you have downloaded, the version number displayed on the Oxipay PrestaShop plugin might be different to the one in the screenshot. This document has been prepared using version 1.1.0.
</div>

<p><strong>10</strong> - Click on the green <strong>Install</strong> button next to the Oxipay PrestaShop listing.</p>
<p><img alt="8.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/8.png" /></p>
<p><strong>11</strong> - Clicking on <strong>Install</strong> will display a prompt requesting that you confirm that you want to go ahead with the installation of the plugin even though it has not been verified by PrestaShop. Click on the orange <strong>Proceed with the Installation</strong> button.</p>
<div class="panel">
  You can ignore the error message that indicates that the Oxipay module could not be verified. This error is displayed because the module was installed locally from your machine, rather than through PrestaShop's module marketplace.
  <br>
  <br>

  <img alt="9.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/9.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;display: block;">
</div>

<p><strong>12</strong> - If the installation is successful, you will be re-directed to the the Oxipay module configuration page with a message at the top of the page indicating that the module was installed successfully.</p>
<p><img alt="10.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/10.png" /></p>
<h2 id="configuring-oxipay">Configuring Oxipay</h2>
<div class="panel">
  This section assumes that you have just finished installing the Oxipay plugin and are still on the <b>Oxipay Configuration</b> page that you were automatically re-directed to after installation. Otherwise, you can bring up this page by using the <b>Configure</b> option - see the <a href="#quick-config-actions">Quick Config Actions</a> section below.
</div>

<p>This section details the various parameters that you would need to configure for you to be able to process payments via the Oxipay payment gateway. This includes things such as the plugin's logo, Oxipay endpoints to communicate with, as well as whether or not to enable Test Mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong> This configures the plugin title that gets displayed to the end user during checkout. By default it is configured to <strong>Oxipay</strong> but you have the option of changing it to something else such as <strong>Oxipay Australia</strong> or <strong>Oxipay Payment Gateway</strong>, for instance.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config1.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config1.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> This controls the Oxipay Logo that gets displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config2.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config2.png" /></p>
<div class="panel">
  To get a copy of the latest Oxipay logo, click on the following link: <a href="../../img/platforms/prestashop/oxipay_icon.svg" target="_blank">Oxipay Official Logo</a>. This will open up a new tab that has the logo. You will first need to save the logo to your local computer, it will be saved as an <code>.svg</code> file. Then upload it to through the <b>Logo</b> config option by clicking on <b>Add file</b>.
  <br><br>
  There is no need to resize the Oxipay logo. You can save it in its full dimensions and it will resize to suit your Oxipay store.
</div>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><strong>Description</strong> This configures the plugin description text that gets displayed to the end user as part of the checkout process. By default, it is configured to <strong>Breathe easy with Oxipay, an interest-free instalment payment plan</strong> but you have the option of changing it to something else.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config3.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config3.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oxipay Gateway URL</strong> This specifies the live Oxipay end-point that the plugin would need to communicate with for it to be able to process payments via Oxipay. Note that transactions processed over this URL are real transactions that end up in real dollar amounts being deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config4.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config4.png" />
<hr></p>
<div class="panel">
  We have intentionally not included the URL in this support document. Please contact us and we will advise you of the <b>Oxipay Gateway URL</b> to use.
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Oxipay Sandbox Gateway URL</strong> This specifies the test Oxipay end-point that the plugin would need to communicate with when <strong>Test Mode</strong> is enabled. This is mainly used for troubleshooting purposes, particularly if we want to simulate test transactions on your PrestaShop store without having real dollar amounts debited from Credit Cards.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Merchant ID</strong> This is the Oxipay Merchant ID that you are provided with as part of your on-boarding when signing-up for Oxipay.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config6.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config6.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Key</strong> The API Key or the Encryption key is a case-sensitive alpha-numeric sequence that is used to authenticate payment requests originating from your store. It is vital that you protect it and don't provide it to unauthorised individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config7.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config7.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test Mode</strong> Indicates whether to process payments over the live Oxipay Gateway URL resulting in real transactions, or to process it over the Oxipay Sandbox Gateway URL which will produce simulated (test) transactions with no real dollar amounts being debited. By default it should be set to <strong>No</strong> unless we are attempting to diagnose issues on your store to do with Oxipay, or you're testing integrating the plugin with your online PrestaShop store.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="config8.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/config8.png" />

<p>Once you have finished making the necessary configuration changes or updates, click the <strong>Save</strong> button on the bottom left. If successful, you will be presented with a message at the top of the page similar to the screenshot below.</p>

<h2 id="quick-config-actions">Quick Config Actions</h2>
<p>PrestaShop allows you to perform quick actions on your installed modules such as disabling the plugin on specific devices or uninstalling it. Although not technically part of the Quick Config Actions sub-menu, you also have access to the <strong>Configure</strong> button. Clicking on it will take you to the <strong>Oxipay Configuration</strong>. </p>
<p>Below is a summary of how to bring up the <strong>Quick Config Actions</strong> sub-menu:</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> - Log into your PrestaShop admin panel.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> - Hover over the <strong>Modules and Services</strong> option on the left side menu, then click on the <strong>Modules and Services</strong> item on the sub-menu that appears.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> - This will re-direct you to the <strong>List of Modules</strong> page.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> - Scroll down until you bring the <strong>Modules List</strong> panel into focus and  type <strong>Oxipay</strong> in the search field in the panel's top left corner. This will bring the Oxipay module into focus and filter out all other modules.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> - If you want to bring up the full <strong>Oxipay Configuration</strong> page, then click on the <strong>Configure</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> - Otherwise, clicking on the arrow next to the <strong>Configure</strong> button will open a drop-down menu similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img alt="12.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/12.png" /></p>
<p>Here is a quick summary of the various <strong>Configure</strong> options available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disable</strong>: Disables the plugin but leaves it installed on your PrestaShop. You can re-enable it with its existing settings at a later time. Oxipay will not appear as a payment option on your store once disabled.
<hr></li>
<li><strong>Disable on mobiles</strong>: This option disables Oxipay only on mobile devices (or smartphones, such as iPhones). This does not apply to tablets (such as iPads) or desktop computers.
<hr></li>
<li><strong>Disable on tablets</strong>: Disables Oxipay on tablets but not smartphones or desktop computers.
<hr></li>
<li><strong>Disable on computers</strong>: Disables Oxipay on desktop computers only.
<hr></li>
<li><strong>Reset</strong>: Resets the Oxipay module to its original state without any of the configuration settings that have been applied post installation.
<hr></li>
<li><strong>Uninstall</strong>: Uninstalls the plugin from your store. The plugin will still be available and you will be able to install it at a later time without having to upload it again.
<hr></li>
<li><strong>Mark as Favorite</strong>: Marks Oxipay as one of your favourite plugins so that it becomes available from within the <strong>Favourites</strong> category list on the left hand side of the <strong>Modules List</strong> panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="13.png" src="../../img/platforms/prestashop/13.png" />
<hr></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delete</strong>: Completely removes the plugin from your store. The plugin will no longer be available for installation again and the only way to add Oxipay back to your store as a payment method would be to perform the instructions in the <a href="#installing-oxipay">Installing Oxipay</a> section of the document again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="upgrading-oxipay">Upgrading Oxipay</h2>
