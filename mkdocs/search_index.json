Issues might be encountered if using an earlier version. If you do encounter issues, then please contact us to resolve them as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Oxipay\n\n\n\n  You will need your \nMerchant ID\n and an \nEncryption Key\n handy before continuing with the installation procdure.\n\n\n\nInstalling the Oxipay Plugin can be done in one of two ways: \nautomatically\n via the WordPress Admin page, or \nmanually\n by copying files to the WordPress server (to be performed by an IT professional or a Web developer).\n\n\n\n  Before proceeding with either option, please ensure that the WooCommerce plugin is properly installed and activated on you WordPress site.
