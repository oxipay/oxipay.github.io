This section details how to upload the plugin, and install and configure its various parameters for it to work properly.\n\n\n\n  Installation of the plugin requires you to be able to access the store's admin area. If you have trouble accessing your PrestaShop's admin area, please consult PrestaShop's official support documentation or your IT department to resolve the issue.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation Procedure\n\n\n1\n - Navigate to the following URL and select the zip file to download the Oxipay plugin.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/oxipay/oxipay-prestashop/releases\n\n\n\n  \noxipay-prestashop\n is a private GitHub repository. If you don't have access, please contact \nsupport@oxipay.com.au\n to get access or to receive the plugin via email.\n\n\n\n\n2\n - Log into your PrestaShop's admin area using an \nEmail address\n and a \nPassword\n combination that has already been configured as an admin.\n\n\n\n\n3\n - Once logged in, you will be presented with your store's dashboard. From the side menu that appears to the left, hover over \nModules and Services\n and then click on \nModules and Services\n from the sub-menu that appears.\n\n\n\n\n4\n - This will take you to the \nModules and Services\n page and will display a list of modules that are available to you that can be either installed or configured on your store.\n\n\n5\n - Scroll down until you bring the \nModules List\n panel into focus.

This will filter all modules out but will leave the \nOxipay Prestashop\n module in focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Depending on the version of the plugin that you have downloaded, the version number displayed on the Oxipay PrestaShop plugin might be different to the one in the screenshot.

Click on the orange \nProceed with the Installation\n button.\n\n\n\n  You can ignore the error message that indicates that the Oxipay module could not be verified. This error is displayed because the module was installed locally from your machine, rather than through PrestaShop's module marketplace.\n  \n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n12\n - If the installation is successful, you will be re-directed to the the Oxipay module configuration page with a message at the top of the page indicating that the module was installed successfully.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Oxipay\n\n\n\n  This section assumes that you have just finished installing the Oxipay plugin and are still on the \nOxipay Configuration\n page that you were automatically re-directed to after installation. Otherwise, you can bring up this page by using the \nConfigure\n option - see the \nQuick Config Actions\n section below.\n\n\n\n\nThis section details the various parameters that you would need to configure for you to be able to process payments via the Oxipay payment gateway. This includes things such as the plugin's logo, Oxipay endpoints to communicate with, as well as whether or not to enable Test Mode.\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n This configures the plugin title that gets displayed to the end user during checkout. By default it is configured to \nOxipay\n but you have the option of changing it to something else such as \nOxipay Australia\n or \nOxipay Payment Gateway\n, for instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo\n This controls the Oxipay Logo that gets displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  To get a copy of the latest Oxipay logo, click on the following link: \nOxipay Official Logo\n. This will open up a new tab that has the logo. You will first need to save the logo to your local computer, it will be saved as an \n.svg\n file. Then upload it to through the \nLogo\n config option by clicking on \nAdd file\n.\n  \n\n  There is no need to resize the Oxipay logo. You can save it in its full dimensions and it will resize to suit your Oxipay store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n This configures the plugin description text that gets displayed to the end user as part of the checkout process. By default, it is configured to \nBreathe easy with Oxipay, an interest-free instalment payment plan\n but you have the option of changing it to something else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxipay Gateway URL\n This specifies the live Oxipay end-point that the plugin would need to communicate with for it to be able to process payments via Oxipay. Note that transactions processed over this URL are real transactions that end up in real dollar amounts being deducted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  We have intentionally not included the URL in this support document. Please contact us and we will advise you of the \nOxipay Gateway URL\n to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxipay Sandbox Gateway URL\n This specifies the test Oxipay end-point that the plugin would need to communicate with when \nTest Mode\n is enabled. This is mainly used for troubleshooting purposes, particularly if we want to simulate test transactions on your PrestaShop store without having real dollar amounts debited from Credit Cards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  We have intentionally not included the URL in this support document. Please contact us and we will advise you of the \nSandbox Oxipay Gateway URL\n to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerchant ID\n This is the Oxipay Merchant ID that you are provided with as part of your on-boarding when signing-up for Oxipay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI Key\n The API Key or the Encryption key is a case-sensitive alpha-numeric sequence that is used to authenticate payment requests originating from your store. It is similar to passwords that you use to login into the various online portals, such as email. It is vital that you protect it and don't provide it to unauthorised individuals. We might also recycle your API and provide you with a new one, if unauthorised individuals get hold of it or if it has been compromised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Mode\n Indicates whether to process payments over the live Oxipay Gateway URL resulting in real transactions, or to process it over the Oxipay Sandbox Gateway URL which will produce simulated (test) transactions with no real dollar amounts being debited. By default it should be set to \nNo\n unless we are attempting to diagnose issues on your store to do with Oxipay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have finished making the necessary configuration changes or updates, click the \nSave\n button on the bottom left. If successful, you will be presented with a message at the top of the page similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nQuick Config Actions\n\n\nPrestaShop allows you to perform quick actions on your installed modules such as disabling the plugin on specific devices or uninstalling it. Although not technically part of the Quick Config Actions sub-menu, you also have access to the \nConfigure\n button. Clicking on it will take you to the \nOxipay Configuration\n. \n\n\nBelow is a summary of how to bring up the \nQuick Config Actions\n sub-menu:\n\n\n1\n - Log into your PrestaShop admin panel.\n\n\n2\n - Hover over the \nModules and Services\n option on the left side menu, then click on the \nModules and Services\n item on the sub-menu that appears.\n\n\n3\n - This will re-direct you to the \nList of Modules\n page.\n\n\n4\n - Scroll down until you bring the \nModules List\n panel into focus and  type \nOxipay\n in the search field in the panel's top left corner. This will bring the Oxipay module into focus and filter out all other modules.\n\n\n5\n - If you want to bring up the full \nOxipay Configuration\n page, then click on the \nConfigure\n button.\n\n\n6\n - Otherwise, clicking on the arrow next to the \nConfigure\n button will open a drop-down menu similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nHere is a quick summary of the various \nConfigure\n options available to you:\n\n\n\n\nDisable\n: Disables the plugin but leaves it installed on your PrestaShop. You can re-enable it with its existing settings at a later time. Oxipay will not appear as a payment option on your store once disabled.\n\n\n\nDisable on mobiles\n: This option disables Oxipay only on mobile devices (or smartphones, such as iPhones). This does not apply to tablets (such as iPads) or desktop computers.\n\n\n\nDisable on tablets\n: Disables Oxipay on tablets but not smartphones or desktop computers.\n\n\n\nDisable on computers\n: Disables Oxipay on desktop computers only.\n\n\n\nReset\n: Resets the Oxipay module to its original state without any of the configuration settings that have been applied post installation.\n\n\n\nUninstall\n: Uninstalls the plugin from your store. The plugin will still be available and you will be able to install it at a later time without having to upload it again.\n\n\n\nMark as Favorite\n: Marks Oxipay as one of your favourite plugins so that it becomes available from within the \nFavourites\n category list on the left hand side of the \nModules List\n panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete\n: Completely removes the plugin from your store. The plugin will no longer be available for installation again and the only way to add Oxipay back to your store as a payment method would be to perform the instructions in the \nInstalling Oxipay\n section of the document again.\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading Oxipay\n\n\nUpgrade your Oxipay PrestaShop plugin then install the newer version. To uninstall the plugin you need to:\n\n\n1\n - Open up the \nQuick Config Actions\n using the instructions in the \nQuick Config Actions\n section of this document.\n\n\n2\n - From the drop-down menu that appears, click \nDelete\n.\n\n\n\n\n3\n - This will display a pop-up in your browser similar to the one shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\n4\n - Click \nOK\n. This will initiate the deletion of the Oxipay plugin. Once completed, you will be presented with a success message at the top of the page similar to the one shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n5\n - You can now download the newer version of the Oxipay PrestaShop plugin and install it as per the instructions in the \nInstalling Oxipay\n section of this document.",

Please contact us and we will advise you of the  Sandbox Oxipay Gateway URL  to use.    Merchant ID  This is the Oxipay Merchant ID that you are provided with as part of your on-boarding when signing-up for Oxipay.      API Key  The API Key or the Encryption key is a case-sensitive alpha-numeric sequence that is used to authenticate payment requests originating from your store. It is similar to passwords that you use to login into the various online portals, such as email. It is vital that you protect it and don't provide it to unauthorised individuals. We might also recycle your API and provide you with a new one, if unauthorised individuals get hold of it or if it has been compromised.      Test Mode  Indicates whether to process payments over the live Oxipay Gateway URL resulting in real transactions, or to process it over the Oxipay Sandbox Gateway URL which will produce simulated (test) transactions with no real dollar amounts being debited. By default it should be set to  No  unless we are attempting to diagnose issues on your store to do with Oxipay.

You can re-enable it with its existing settings at a later time. Oxipay will not appear as a payment option on your store once disabled.  Disable on mobiles : This option disables Oxipay only on mobile devices (or smartphones, such as iPhones). This does not apply to tablets (such as iPads) or desktop computers.  Disable on tablets : Disables Oxipay on tablets but not smartphones or desktop computers.  Disable on computers : Disables Oxipay on desktop computers only.  Reset : Resets the Oxipay module to its original state without any of the configuration settings that have been applied post installation.  Uninstall : Uninstalls the plugin from your store. The plugin will still be available and you will be able to install it at a later time without having to upload it again.  Mark as Favorite : Marks Oxipay as one of your favourite plugins so that it becomes available from within the  Favourites  category list on the left hand side of the  Modules List  panel.      Delete : Completely removes the plugin from your store. The plugin will no longer be available for installation again and the only way to add Oxipay back to your store as a payment method would be to perform the instructions in the  Installing Oxipay  section of the document again.",

Step 2 : The customer is redirected to the Oxipay checkout endpoint via a  HTTP POST  (See  Request POST  for details). Note that this post needs to be signed to ensure security (See  Signature Generation  for details).  Step 3 : The customer will then complete the purchase via the Oxipay Service. Customers that cancel will be redirected back to the  x_url_cancel  URL.  Step 4 : Once a decision has been reached ('Approved' or 'Declined'), Oxipay will  POST  (Server to Server) to the provided  x_url_callback  URL  (See  Response POST  content).    Step 5 : The customer is then presented with an 'Approved' or 'Declined' page.  The customer is then redirected ( GET ) to the provided  x_url_complete  with the same  response  content as used in  Step 4 .    Step 6 : The transaction is now complete from Oxipay side as well as the client's and shopping cart's point of views.",

This can be viewed as an authorisation request that is performed by the shopping cart in order to process the payment via Oxipay.\n\n\nThere are two Oxipay endpoints that transaction information can be posted to and they represent the live Oxipay payment gateway and the test (sandbox) gateway.\n\n\nOxipay Endpoints\n\n\nPosting a request to the live payment gateway with the \nx_test\n set to \nfalse\n will process a real transaction. This means the credit card that was used as part of the checkout process will be debited. On the other hand, posting to the test gateway simulates a transaction and is not processed as a real transaction; that is, no real dollar amount will be debited from the specified credit card.\n\n\nTo test Oxipay, you can use the test (sandbox) URL or you can use the live payment gateway with the testing flag enabled \nx_test = true\n. \nTest transactions will not incur any debits, and any credit card details will not be stored. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxipay Environment\n\n\nURL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction Endpoint\n\n\nhttps://secure.oxipay.com.au/Checkout?platform=Default\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandbox Endpoint\n\n\nhttps://securesandbox.oxipay.com.au/Checkout?platform=Default\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest POST\n\n\nPosting to the Oxipay endpoint, regardless of whether this is done in the live or test environment, should be done using the format \napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\n.

This section provides information on how you can use HMAC-SHA256 for signing and verification purposes.\n\n\nAs mentioned, Oxipay uses HMAC-SHA256 for purposes of signing and verifying requests.\n\n\nBelow is an example that demonstrates how you can go about implementing a method in a shopping platform that is based on PHP to generate the signature.\n\n\nPHP Example\n\n\nBelow is a PHP code snippet that demonstrates how a signature might be generated in the context of Oxipay:\n\n\n    function oxipay_sign($query, $api_key )\n    {\n        $clear_text = '';\n        ksort($query);\n        foreach ($query as $key => $value) {\n            if (substr($key, 0, 2) === \"x_\") {\n                $clear_text .= $key . $value;\n            }\n        }\n        $hash = hash_hmac( \"sha256\", $clear_text, $api_key);\n        return str_replace('-', '', $hash);\n    }\n\n\n\n\nFirst note that the method expects two parameters and they are \n$query\n and \n$api_key\n. The \n$query\n represents the various key-value pairs that form your HTTP request POST and vary depending on the information that is entered as part of the checkout process on your shopping cart.\n\n\nThe parameter \n$api_key\n represents the API Key that is unique for every merchant. It should only change once the API key has been changed on the Oxipay side.\n\n\nHaving received the two parameters, the \noxipay_sign\n method will then perform an alphabetical sorting of the various key-value pairs based on the key but still maintaining the correlation between the keys and their respective values.\n\n\nThe method will then examine the \n$query\n variable for the various key-value pairs by checking for the \nx_\n prefix and would then append them together.\n\n\nThe method then computes the keyed hash value using the \nhash_hmac\n method.",
